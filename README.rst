🚀 Key Features
--------------

Developer Experience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automatic code formatting and quality checks
- **Modern Tooling**: Latest Python development tools and best practices
- **IDE Configuration**: VS Code settings and task configurations included
- **Environment Management**: Conda and pip-tools support for dependency management

Quick Start
-----------
1. Create an environment in github called `main` and set the following features:
    - Required reviewers: my-name
    - Allow admins to bypass: disabled
    - Deployment branches and tags: main
    - Environment secrets:
        - ``ADMIN_TOKEN``: Administration and actions (read and write)
2. Set the following secrets in your repository settings:
    - ``PAT_TOKEN``: Content and Pull Requests (read and write)
    - ``PYPI_API_TOKEN``: Your PyPI token
    - ``TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN``: Your Test PyPI token
3. Modify the `.github/workflows/configure_repo.yml` file to set up the minimum (an maximum) python versions, and a list of topics
4. Run the `configure_repo` workflow manually from the Actions tab
5. Set up read the docs to build documentation for this project
6. Clone your repository and start coding!
